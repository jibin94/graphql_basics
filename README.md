## Graphql

In GraphQL, operations are divided into three main types: queries, mutations, and subscriptions. These operations allow you to interact with the server in different ways.

**Queries**
In GraphQL, queries are used to retrieve data from a server and request specific fields from that data. They allow us to specify exactly what data we require, reducing over- and under-fetching.<br />

**Mutation**
A mutation is an operation that allows you to modify data on a GraphQL client; unlike a query, a mutation is used to create, update, or delete data.<br />

**Subscription**
Subscriptions in GraphQL are similar to queries, but unlike queries, subscriptions allow us to subscribe to real-time updates from a GraphQL API.
